Here is how the fection of the boxes should go from the database.
fectch all the boxes related to location,booking
order them by the booked order
but boxed booked for a long time are going to be rebooked again.
so order should be by time booked from start to return time.
skip the cancelled bookings 
meaning we need a score column in boxes to store score


In Use is displayed in two lines fix that 
2remove the box icons near model


apply the same principles of customer starts hear from from the icon placement and different view of them in small screen 
remember we are talking about stars section the upper part below the header
