Here is how the fection of the boxes should go from the database.
fectch all the boxes related to location,booking
order them by the booked order
but boxed booked for a long time are going to be rebooked again.
so order should be by time booked from start to return time.
skip the cancelled bookings 
meaning we need a score column in boxes to store score
